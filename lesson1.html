<h3>Display Property </h3> 
<p><b>CSS display property allows you to control how an element is displayed.</p> 
	<br>
		<h3>Block Level Element</h3>
<p><b>Block level elements take up as much space as possible by default. Each block level element will start a new line on the page,<br> stacking down the page. In addition to stacking vertically,block level elements will also take up as much horizontal spaceas possible.</p> <br>
	<h3> Inline Level Element </h3>
	<p><b>Inline elements display in a line. They do not force the text after them to a new line. An anchor (or link) is an example of an inline element. <br> You can put several links in a row, and they will display in aline. </p> <br>
		<h3>Why is this important?</h3>
<p><b>How an element behaves when styled with CSS willchange based on the display mode of an element
(block vs. inline).<br> Some CSS properties react differently for each display type. <br> We'll learn more about this behavior when we start to lay out pages in CSS.</p> <br>
	<h3> Span and Div Tags </h3>
	<p>
• Span and Div tags do not have default styling information. </br>
• Changing the style or formatting of the line or block coveredby the tag, you need to specify an attribute to affect thedesired style. </br>
• Most HTML tags apply formatting just like tags for headings,lists and others, but there are some that do not have anyspecific effect, namely the container tags span and div but are actually used quite extensively inconjunction with CSS. </br>
• Simply put, span and div tags are just used to format a partof the content by usually using CSS. </br>
• The general difference between span and div is that div has line breaks before andafter it. </br>
• Usually the span is used for small chunks of codewhile div is for larger ones. </p> </br>
