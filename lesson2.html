	<p> How Do Style Sheet Work? </br>
 Style sheets are just text files, or text embedded in the head of an HTML document, that help separate content from appearance. The content of the page goes into an HTML file. And the appearance goes into a style sheet. But how does all this end up as a web page in the reader’s browser?
A style sheet suggests the browser to display a page in a particular way, how the pages should be displayed in the browser.
There are two things that you should remember
when using the CSS code:<br>
1. The type attribute should always be style type text/css <br>
2. CSS code should be enclosed in HTML comments  so that in a web browser that does not understand CSS, the browser will not see the CSS code. But today, however, all current browsers support CSS. <br>
Three Kinds of CSS <br>
	<br>
External Style Sheets <br>
• the most global of the three kinds of CSS because youcan apply the same one to an unlimited number ofpages
• allows you to develop a consistent style across pages
• easily allow you to change the layout of your entireweb site by simply changing the external style sheetand every page is instantly updated
• has a .css file extension <br>
	<br>
Embedded Style Sheets (Internal Style Sheets) <br>
• used for creating a document-wide style rule
• placed within an HTML document, between the head
• used when you have a page that you want to presentin a different style from other pages
• embedded style sheets override external style sheets <br>
	<br>
Inline Style Sheets <br>
• used for isolated changes to a headline, paragraph,picture or other element
• stored directly in the style attributes of the HTML tags
• inline style sheets override external and embeddedstyle sheets
