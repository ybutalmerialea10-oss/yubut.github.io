<h3>What is CSS?</h3>
• CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets

Layers of a Webpage Just like how the elements of human body were layered and placed on top of each other– bones, muscles, veins, etc., to become a whole, the web page, is also composed of layers to make it whole.
 <h3>The layers of a webpage: </h3>
 3. Behavior Layer
 2. Presentation Layer
 1. Content Layer
 Each layer of the webpage has its specific use or function in the web page. Each plays an important role to be able to attain the goal or objective of a particular website.
<h3>Content Layer</h3>
 The content layer is where you: <br>
 * define and layout the text, images, animation, sound, 
 video and everything you want to put in a web page  with the use of tags <br>
 * is the underlying HTML code of that page. Just as a  house's frame creates a strong foundation upon which  the rest of the house is built, a solid foundation of HTML  creates a platform upon which a website can be created
 In comparison, HTML is used to create the actual  content/foundation of the page and CSS is responsible for the design or style of the website, including the layout, visual effects and background color <br> <br>
